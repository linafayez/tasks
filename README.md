# 📝 tasks_joddb

A simple and clean To-Do app.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This app is built with:

- **Flutter** version: `3.22.3`

- **Sqflite** as a local database to store tasks  
- **BLoC** for state management  
- **GetIt** for dependency injection  

## 📌 Notes

- This app **does not follow the provided Figma design**, as I already implemented my own UI.
- You're welcome to explore the code, test the features, and share feedback!
